Functional requirements: are statements of what a software system must do to meet the needs of its users. They are typically written in plain language and should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.

Non-functional requirements: Non-functional requirements (NFRs) specify how a software system should perform, focusing on aspects like speed, security, and usability, rather than specific features.

Agile model: Small increments of software are developed in a sequence of sprints, each of which creates deployable code.
